          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Born and raised in Chicago’s Chinatown area, I am a first-generation
            student who gained my first exposure in computer science through
            <a
              href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science"
              >CS50</a
            >. Discovering my passion for learning and the challenges that came
            with it, this experience inspired me to pursue Computer Science in
            college, where I continue to build on my skills and knowledge.

          <h2>Where I am now</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently a junior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison,
            pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Data Science. Most of my
            learning takes place outside of the classroom. Last Fall, I had my
            first experience with
            <a href="https://www.codepath.org/">CodePath</a> through their Web
            Development course. The experience helped me appreciate the value of
            hands-on projects and having deadlines. Since then, I’ve continued
            to take additional courses to build my repertoire of technical
            skills, and this Summer, I’m serving as a Tech Fellow for the
            Technical Interview Prep course to give back to the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside, I'm working as a Technical Project Management intern at
            <a
              href="https://www.carscommerce.inc/?cars_ad_id&cars_channel=pmax&cars_platform_account_id=7200961417&cars_platform=google&cars_fuel_id=4730&gaw_ad_group_id&gaw_campaign_id=20355616286"
              >Cars Commerce</a

            opportunity to build on both my soft and technical skills.

          <h2>Where I'm going</h2>
          <p>
            My current summer internship has broadened my perspective, making me
            more open to exploring various career roles beyond software
            development. I’m eager to gain as much experience as possible before
            I graduate. In the remaining years of my college journey, I plan to
            immerse myself in new technologies, expand my professional network,
            and discover my strengths and weaknesses. I will continue to
            leverage learning opportunities like
            <a href="https://www.codepath.org/">CodePath</a> and
            <a href="https://headstarter.co/">headstarter</a> to further my
            development.

              <h3>Try, Fail, Learn</h3>
              <p>
                When I first started my journey in web development, I wrote
                awful code. Then, I wrote slightly better code. When I tried iOS
                development with Swift, I wrote awful code again. Then, slightly
                better code. Learning computer science is this same iterative
                process, repeated over and over again.

              <h3>Every Opportunity is a Hidden Gem</h3>
              <p>
                I began my journey in the restaurant industry—far from tech, but
                rich in lessons. No matter what you’re doing, even a small daily
                commitment to learning adds up over time. Embrace every
                opportunity as a chance to grow.

              <h3>Enjoy the detour</h3>
              <p>
                Life rarely goes as planned. If you’re fixated on the straight
                path, you’ll miss the hidden treasures along the way. Embrace
                every detour! My goal was to be a software engineer, but as a
                technical project management intern, I’m discovering new
                strengths and aspirations. Sometimes the unexpected route is
                exactly what you need.
